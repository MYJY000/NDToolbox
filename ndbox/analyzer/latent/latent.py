Gaussian-Process Factor Analysis (GPFA)
    https://elephant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/gpfa.html
    Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA) is a dimensionality reduction method (Yu et al., 2008) for neural 
    trajectory visualization of parallel spike trains. GPFA applies factor analysis (FA) to time-binned spike 
    count data to reduce the dimensionality and at the same time smoothes the resulting low-dimensional 
    trajectories by fitting a Gaussian process (GP) model to them.
